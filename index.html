        <h2>Freshman Student in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman Biblical Studies major at Bob Jones University with a minor in Business.
            
            I currently work at my home church, View Church, in Boiling Springs, SC under the youth pastor as his intern/personal assistant.
         </p>
         <p>
            I attend View Church, where I work, with my family. I have two younger sisters and a younger brother as well. 
             I have a dog named Cocoa, and a furry cat named MR. Stripes. My favorite thing to do is to play basketball. 
                                  I also love woodworking and building things with my hands.                    
         </p> 
         <p>
            I love listening to music and spending time with my family and friends. I love watching movies 
                and playing board games. If I could travel anywhere in the world I would travel to Italy. 
            My favorite food by far is french fries, but I love ice cream and pizza too. I am a huge Milwaukee Bucks fan.
                    I love Ford Raptor trucks and I hope to one day purchase one. 
         </p>
